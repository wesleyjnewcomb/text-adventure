# Text Adventure
An Escape the Room text adventure

## Introduction
This project was initially created during a Hackathon, with the goal to ship the project the same day. Our goal was to practice immutability and utilize stateful components in React to keep track of the game state. We designed the app with the option to create and load a different game in the future.

## Technologies
